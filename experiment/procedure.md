### Procedure

There are four tasks in this experiment.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Encoding:**
*   The objective of this task is to encode a message into a codeword using generator matrix.
*   First enter a binary message and click on **Submit**.
*   The entered message will be displayed in **Observations**.
*   Enter the encoded codeword corresponding to the message and click on **submit**.
*   The correctness of the entered codeword is displayed in **Observations**.
*   If the answer is correct, click on **Reset** to try these steps again with a different binary message.

**Procedure for Codebook Generation:**
*   The objective of this task is to generate the entire codebook of a linear block code using the given generator matrix.
*   Enter the codeword corresponding to the message and click on **Submit**.
*   The correctness of the entered codeword is displayed in **Observations**.
*   If the codeword entered is correct, enter the next codeword. Repeat this procedure until the entire codebook is generated.
*   **Reset** - Resets the codeword and clears the **Observations**.

**Procedure for Generator Matrix:**
*   The objective of this task is to find the generator matrix of a code from the given codebook. 
*   Initially, all the vectors are in grey color.
*   Clicking on a vector changes its color from grey to green. Green background indicate that a vector is selected.
*   To deselect a vector, click on it again. Its color changes back to grey.
*   Select 3 codewords one by one to form the rows of the generator matrix and click on **Submit**.
*   **Observations** section displays whether a valid generator matrix is selected or not.
*   For systematic generator matrix, the **order** in which the codewords are selected is **important**.
*   **Reset** - Deselects all the vectors and brings it back to the initial state.

**Procedure for Parity-Check Matrix:**
*  The objective of this task is to find all the codewords of a code from the given parity-check matrix.
*   Initially, all the vectors are in grey color.
*   Clicking on a vector changes its color from grey to green. All the vectors with green background are the selected vectors.
*   To deselect a vector, click on it again. Its color changes back to grey.
*   Select all the vectors which are the codewords of the given code \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) and click on **Submit**.
*   **Observations** section displays whether all the codewords have been selected or not.
