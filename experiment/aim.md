# Aim

The aim of this experiment is to introduce students with the concepts of
a generator matrix and a parity check matrix of a linear block code.
Students will learn how to encode a message using the given generator
matrix and also construct a generator matrix associated with the given
code. We will then introduce a parity check matrix of the code and also
explore some properties of the generator and parity check matrix of the
code.
